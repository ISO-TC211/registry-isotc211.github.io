The "`ISO/TC 211 Registries site`" is now launched.

Previously, https://registry.isotc211.org pointed to the
ISO Geodetic Registry.

In the 48th Plenary of ISO/TC 211, it has been decided that
https://registry.isotc211.org will point to all ISO/TC 211
registries, and the ISO Geodetic Registry should be migrated
to https://geodetic.isotc211.org, at the recommendation
by HMMG and the ISO Geodetic Registry Control Body.

Therefore this site will provide reference to all ISO/TC 211
registries.

This action is performed by the official web host of
ISO/TC 211, https://www.ribose.com[Ribose].
